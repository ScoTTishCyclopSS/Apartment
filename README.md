# OpenGL Apartment

A simple apartment scene created in OpenGL

# Description

The goal of the project was to create an OpenGL scene with the theme "Apartment". 
My apartment in my hometown was taken as a base :) 
A side task was to fill the apartment with objects and also some of them had to be interactive 
(not cutouts, but ones that would fit the scene and fit the theme of the project).

# Controls
The control uses standard input devices - keyboard and mouse.
**mouse** - to look around
**wasd** - to move in space
**p** - to change the control position
**l** - to block the camera angle of view (blocking input devices)
**f** - to turn the fog on/off
**t** - to switch between fog types (linear / exponential)
**r** - to turn on/off the reflector ('flashlight')
**e** - to switch on/off the directional light
**m** - to switch the wireframe mode on/off
**esc** - to exit the application
